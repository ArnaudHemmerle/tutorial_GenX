# Tutorials GenX

Here you will find small tutorials on how to use GenX (https://aglavic.github.io/genx/index.html).

## howto_batch
The notebook ```batch_genx.ipynb``` details the different steps on how to use GenX with command lines.
The aim is to batch fits for XRR without the GUI. To do so we edit the .hgx files, which are just hdf5 files.

The script ```batch_genx.py``` is a condensed script without all the details from the notebook.

## howto_parameters
Explains what are the different parameters in the GUI.

## examples
Temporary, should be redone in the future.
